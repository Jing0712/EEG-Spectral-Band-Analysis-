This study investigates the functional connectivity in the theta (4-8 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) EEG spectral bands in individuals with ADHD using Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). We compare connectivity pat-terns between ADHD and non-ADHD groups using XAI-created functional connectivity graphs across different emotional states. Through the computa-tion of functional connectivity matrices, Independent Component Analysis (ICA), and the creation of emotion distance matrices, our analysis reveals notable differences in EEG connectivity, particularly in the theta and beta bands. These findings enhance our understanding of ADHD's neurobiologi-cal underpinnings and suggest potential biomarkers for future clinical ap-plications.
