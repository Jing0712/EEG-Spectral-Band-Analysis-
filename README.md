EEG Spectral Band Analysis in Mental Health: Insights from Explainable AI in Functional Connectivity
Authors: Jing Chang, Amir Assadi
Affiliation: University of Wisconsin, Madison
In this study, we analyze functional connectivity in EEG spectral bands theta (4-8 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) using Explainable AI (XAI) methods. The research focuses on ADHD vs. non-ADHD groups across different emotional states.
